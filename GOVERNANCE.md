The Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) are governed by [Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC)](https://oascities.org/about/).

Governance includes:
- External Contributors
- Working Groups
- Council of Cities

## External Contributors

The Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms community adheres to the following principles:
* Open: as little restrictions as possible for anyone to reuse adapt the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms to their context
* Welcoming: as a community we want to make it easier for new users to become contributors
* Respectful: ideas and contributions are accepted according to their alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles

We appreciate contributions in the form of feedback, issues and pull requests.
We intend to respond to each contribution if and when possible, but may not always have the capacity to do so.

**The governance of the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms is not open.**

This means contributors will not always receive feedback on if & why their contribution was considered, accepted, or rejected.

## Working Groups: Development version

The development version of the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms is maintained by a working group.

Participation in the working group is only open to:
* OASC members 
* OASC strategic partners
* Living-in.EU Technical Working Group members
* External experts that are invited for ad hoc consultation

The working group member list is not public.

[Sign up to join a working group](https://forms.gle/EWyN9b4xWEmkNSMo8)

Each working group is coordinated by:
* A champion, who leads the working group and represents the cities and communities
* A facilitator, who supports the champion on behalf of OASC

The current coordinators are:
* Champion: Bart De Lathouwer, Geonovum
* Facilitator: Claus Mullie, OASC

### Responsibilities

The working group members are responsible for:

- Providing technical direction for the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms
- Contributing their relevant expertise
- Assisting with dissemination 
- Solliciting feedback and external contributions 
- Resolve issues in development
- Refining the governance as needed

The champion and facilitator are responsible for:

* Merging pull requests
* Preparing working group meetings
* Maintaining scope and pace in the working group
* Resolving impasses in decision making
* Handling code of conduct violations

### Meetings

The working group meets regularly.
Their agenda includes review of the roadmap and issues that are at an impasse.
The intention of the meeting is not to review or approve all open pull requests.
(Reviewing and approving pull requests is done through the process described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).)

### Decision making process

The decision making process is consent as a default, and voting for certain matters.

For this community, “consent” means that if you think that a decision is uncontroversial you can just go ahead and make that decision.
Any decision made this way is considered supported as long as no one objects.
Of course, you have to be prepared to roll back your work if someone does object.

If there is uncertainty about a decision, a steering team member can inform the rest of the team that they are about to take a certain decision.
If no team member objects within 96 hours, the decision is considered supported.

If objections are made, and no solutions can be found through discussion, the issue can be raised at the next working group meeting.

## Council of Cities: Release version  

A new version of the Minimum Interoperability Mechanisms is released each year, upon approval of the Council of Cities.
The Council of Cities is advised by the OASC Technology Council.

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct is explained in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
